## ARCHITECTURE HIGHLIGHTS

### Design Patterns Used
1. **State Machine**: Enemy state management
2. **Object Pool**: Performance optimization
3. **Observer Pattern**: Scene communication via registry
4. **Factory Pattern**: Asset and entity creation
5. **Strategy Pattern**: Path following, targeting (ready for towers)

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Object Pooling**: Enemies and projectiles (ready)
2. **Fixed Depth Layers**: No dynamic sorting
3. **Arcade Physics**: Lightweight collision detection
4. **Placeholder Graphics**: Minimal texture memory
5. **Offscreen Culling**: Don't update invisible objects

### Code Quality
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, full type safety
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive JSDoc comments
- **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Naming**: Descriptive, consistent conventions
- **Error Handling**: Validation and logging
